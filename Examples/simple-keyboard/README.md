# simple-keyboard

simple-ceyboard uses `inlineKeyboardMarkup` to continuously update an example of a message sent. This is a cool feature of Telegram.

When you send a `/start` to the BOT, it will reply to you with a message in Chinese, and then you can choose to update the message to English and French versions using the two buttons below.

This sample code comes from the https://github.com/HDCodePractice/CityHelper .
