    /// Use this method when you need to tell the user that something is happening on the bot's side. The status is set for 5 seconds or less (when a message arrives from your bot, Telegram clients clear its typing status).

    /// We only recommend using this method when a response from the bot will take a noticeable amount of time to arrive.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///     - chat_id: Unique identifier for the target chat or username of the target channel (in the format @channelusername)
    ///     - action: Type of action to broadcast. Choose one, depending on what the user is about to receive: typing for text messages, upload_photo for photos, record_video or upload_video for videos, record_audio or upload_audio for audio files, upload_document for general files, find_location for location data.
    /// - Returns: Bool on success. Nil on error, in which case `TelegramBot.lastError` contains the details.
