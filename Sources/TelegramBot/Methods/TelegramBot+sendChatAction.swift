    /// Example: The ImageBot needs some time to process a request and upload the image. Instead of sending a text message along the lines of “Retrieving image, please wait…”, the bot may use sendChatAction with action = upload_photo. The user will see a “sending photo” status for the bot.
    /// We only recommend using this method when a response from the bot will take a noticeable amount of time to arrive.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///     - chat_id: Unique identifier for the target chat or username of the target channel (in the format @channelusername)
    ///     - action: Type of action to broadcast. Choose one, depending on what the user is about to receive: typing for text messages, upload_photo for photos, record_video or upload_video for videos, record_audio or upload_audio for audio files, upload_document for general files, find_location for location data.
    /// - Returns: Bool on success. Nil on error, in which case `TelegramBot.lastError` contains the details.
