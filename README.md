Trivial bot:

```swift
import TelegramBot

let bot = TelegramBot(token: "my token")
let router = Router(bot)

router["greet"] = { context in
    guard let from = context.message?.from else { return false }
    context.respondAsync("Hello, \(from.first_name)!")
    return true
}

router[.new_chat_member] = { context in
	guard let user = context.message?.new_chat_member else { return false }
	guard user.id != bot.user.id else { return false }
	context.respondAsync("Welcome, \(user.first_name)!")
	return true
}

while let update = bot.nextUpdateSync() {
	try router.process(update: update)
}

fatalError("Server stopped due to error: \(bot.lastError)")
```

## Telegram chat

Join our chat in Telegram: [swiftsdkchat](https://telegram.me/swiftsdkchat).

## What's new

[Release notes](https://github.com/zmeyc/telegram-bot-swift/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) contain the significant changes in each release with migration notes.

## Installation

OS X is required. Linux support is planned, but not ready yet.

On OS X, install `Swift 3.0 DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-08-26-a` by following instructions on Wiki: [Setting Up Dev Environment](https://github.com/zmeyc/telegram-bot-swift/wiki/Dev%20Environment).


## Getting started

Please get familiar with the documentation on Telegram website:

* [Bots: An introduction for developers](https://core.telegram.org/bots)

* [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api)


## Creating a new bot

In Telegram, add `BotFather`. Send him these commands:

```
/newbot
BotName
username_of_my_bot
```

BotFather will return a token.

Create a project for your bot:

```
mkdir hello-bot
cd hello-bot
swift package init --type executable

```

Create `Package.swift`:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "hello-bot",
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/zmeyc/telegram-bot-swift.git", majorVersion: 0)
    ]
)
```

Create `Sources/main.swift`:

```swift
import Foundation
import TelegramBot

let token = readToken(from: "HELLO_BOT_TOKEN")
let bot = TelegramBot(token: token)

while let update = bot.nextUpdateSync() {
    if let message = update.message, let from = message.from, let text = message.text {
        bot.sendMessageAsync(chat_id: from.id,
                             text: "Hi \(from.first_name)! You said: \(text).\n")
    }
}

fatalError("Server stopped due to error: \(bot.lastError)")
```

> Do not commit your token to git!

`readToken` reads token from environment variable or from a file. So, either create an environment variable:

```
export HELLO_BOT_TOKEN='token'
```

Or save the token to a file and add the file to .gitignore:

```
echo token > HELLO_BOT_TOKEN
```

Build your bot:

```
swift build
```

And run it:

```
.build/debug/hello-bot
```

More details are available on Wiki: [New Bot](https://github.com/zmeyc/telegram-bot-swift/wiki/New-Bot).

## Generating Xcode project

It's easy:

```
swift package generate-xcodeproj
```

Open generated `hello-bot.xcodeproj` and switch the active scheme to the bottom one:

<img src="https://github.com/zmeyc/telegram-bot-swift/wiki/img/scheme.jpg" width=419>

Don't forget to add your token to environment variables in Xcode (Scheme settings -> Run).

Press CMD-R to start the bot.

## API overview

### Type and request names

SDK type and request names closely mirror [original Telegram ones](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). We decided not to use camel case naming and opted to use Telegram's snake_case instead.

Swift types and enums were added where appropriate:
 

```swift
if entity.type == .bot_command { ... }
```

In most cases raw methods accepting strings are also available. They can be used as fallbacks if required enum case is not added yet:

```swift
if entity.type_string == "bot_command" { ... }
```

To allow accessing fields which are still missing in SDK, every data type has `json` member with original json structure:

```swift
if entity.json["type"].stringValue == "bot_command" { ... }
```

All types conform to `JsonConvertible` protocol and can be created from json or serialized back to json. Use `debugDescription` method for human-readable json or `description` for json which can be sent to server.

### Requests

**Sync and Async**

Request names closely mirror Telegram ones, but have two versions: `synchronous` and `asynchronous` with method suffixes `Sync` and `Async` correspondingly.

* Synchronous methods block until the operation is completed.

```swift
let fromId: Int64 = 12345678 // your user id
bot.sendMessageSync(fromId, "Hello!") // blocks until the message is sent
bot.sendMessageSync(fromId, "Bye.")
```

These methods return a server response or `nil` in case of error. If `nil` is returned, details can be obtained by querying `bot.lastError`.

```swift
guard let sentMessage = bot.sendMessageSync(fromId, "Hello") else {
    fatalError("Unable to send message: \(bot.lastError.unwrapOptional)")
}
```

Do not use synchronous methods in real apps because they're slow. Use them when debugging or for experimenting in `REPL`. More details: [Using Swift REPL for calling API methods](https://github.com/zmeyc/telegram-bot-swift/wiki/Using-Swift-REPL-for-calling-API-methods)

* Asynchronous methods accept an optional completion handler which will be called when operation is completed.

Completion handler is called on main thread by default.

```swift
bot.sendMessageAsync(fromId, "Hello!") { result, error in
  // message sent!
  bot.sendMessageAsync(fromId, "Bye.")
}
// execution continues immediately
```

In completion handler `result` contains the server response or `nil` in case of error. Details can be obtained by querying `error`.

For simplicity, it's possible to synchronously process messages, but respond asynchronously to avoid blocking the processing of the next message. So, a typical bot's main loop can look like this:

```swift
while let update = bot.nextUpdateSync() {
  // process the message and call Async methods
}
```

**Request parameters**

Parameter names should be specified explicitly in most cases:

```swift
bot.sendLocationAsync(chat_id: chatId, latitude: 50.4501, longitude: 30.5234)
```

Exception to this are `sendMessageSync/Async` and `respondSync/Async` functions which are used very often. Parameter names can be omitted in them:

```swift
bot.sendMessageAsync(chat_id: chatId, text: "Text")
bot.sendMessageAsync(chatId, "Text") // will also work
```

`Optional` parameters can also be passed:

```swift
let markup = ForceReply()
bot.sendMessageAsync(chat_id: chatId, text: "Force reply",
    reply_markup: markup, disable_notification: true)
```

If you ever encounter a situation when parameter hasn't been added to method signature yet, you can pass a dictionary with any parameters at the end of parameter list:

```swift
let markup = ForceReply()
bot.sendMessageAsync(chat_id: chatId, text: "Force reply",
    ["reply_markup": markup, "disable_notification": true])
```

It's also possible to set default parameter values for a request:

```swift
bot.defaultParameters["sendMessage"] = ["disable_notification": true]
```

In dictionaries `nil` values will be treated as `no value` and won't be sent to Telegram server.

**Available requests**

Check `TelegramBot/Requests` subdirectory for a list of available requests.

If you find a missing request, please create a ticket and it will be added. Until then, an arbitrary unsupported endpoint can be called like this:

```swift
let user: User? = requestSync("sendMessage", ["chat_id": chatId, "text": text])
```

Or async version:

```swift
requestAsync("sendMessage", ["chat_id": chatId, "text": text]) { (result: User?, error: DataTaskError?) -> () in
    ...
}
```

These methods automatically deserialize the json response.

Explicitly specifying result type is important. Result type should conform to `JsonConvertible` protocol. `Bool` and `Int` already conform to `JsonConvertible`.

JSON class itself also conforms to `JsonConvertible`, so you can request a raw json if needed:

```swift
let user: JSON? = requestSync("sendMessage", ["chat_id": chatId, "text": text])
```

### Routing

Router maps text commands and other events to their handler functions and helps parsing command arguments.

```swift
let router = Router(bot)
router["command1"] = handler1
router["command2"] = handler2
router[.event] = handler3
...
router.process(update: update)
```

Multiple commands can be specified in a single rule:

```swift
router["Full Command Name", "command"] = handler
```

Multiword commands are also supported:

```swift
router["list add"] = onListAdd
router["list remove"] = onListRemove
```

Routers can be chained. This helps creating a context-sensitive routers with fallback to a global router.

```swift
router1.unmatched = router2.handler
```

**Handlers**

Handlers take `Context` argument and return `Bool`.

 * If handler returns `true`, command matching stops.
 * If handler returns `false`, other paths will be matched.
 
So, in handler check preconditions and return false if they aren't satisfied:

```swift
router["reboot"] = { context in
    guard let fromId = context.fromId where isAdmin(fromId) else { return false }
    
    context.respondAsync("I will now reboot the PC.") { _ in
        reboot()
    }
    
    return true
}
```

Handler functions can be marked as `throws` and throw exceptions. Router won't process them and will simply pass the exceptions to caller.

`Context` is a request context, it contains:
 
 * `bot` - a reference to the bot.
 * `update` - current `Update` structure.
 * `message` - convenience method for accessing `update.message`. If `update.message` is nil, fallbacks to `update.edited_message`, then to `update.callback_query?.message`.
 * `command` - command without slash.
 * `slash` - true, if command was prefixed with a slash. Useful if you want to skip commands not starting with slash in group chats.
 * `args` - command arguments scanner.
 * `properties` - context sensitive properties. Pass them to `process` method:

```swift
var properties = [String: AnyObject]()
properties["myField"] = myValue
try router.process(update: update, properties: properties)
```

And use them in handlers:

```swift
func myHandler(context: Context) -> Bool {
    let myValue = context.properties["myField"] as? MyValueType
    // ...
}
```

Or make a `Context` category for easier access to your properties, for example:

```swift
extension Context {
    var session: Session { return properties["session"] as! Session }
}
```
 
`Context` also contains a few helper methods and variables:
 
 * `privateChat` - true, if this is a private chat with bot, false for all group chat types.
 * `chatId` - shortcut for message?.chat.id. If message is nil, tries to retrieve chatId from other `Update` fields.
 * `fromId` - shortcut for message?.from?.id. If message is nil, tries to retrieve fromId from other `Update` fields.
 * `respondAsync`, `respondSync` - works as `sendMessage(chatId, ...)`
 * `respondPrivatelyAsync/Sync("text", groupText: "text")` - respond to user privately, sending a short message to the group if this was a group chat. For example:
 
```swift
context.respondPrivatelyAsync("Command list: ...",
    groupText: "Please find a list of commands in a private message.")
```

 * `reportErrorAsync/Sync(text: "User text", errorDescription: "Detailed error description for administrator")` - sends a short message to user and prints detailed error description to a console. `text` parameter can be omitted, in which case user will receive a generic error message. 

**Text commands**

Router can match text commands:

```swift
router["start"] = onStart
```

Command name is processed differently in private and group chats:

* In private chats slash is optional. `start` matches `/start` as well as `start`.
* It group chats 'start' only matches `/start`.

This can be overridden. The following line will require slash even in private chats:

```swift
router["start", .slashRequired] = onStart
```

Router is case-insensitive by default. To make it case-sensitive, pass `.caseSensitive` option:

```swift
router["command", .caseSensitive] = handler
```

Multiple options can be passed:

```swift
router["command", [.slashRequired, .caseSensitive]] = handler
```

In Telegram group chats, user can append bot name to a command, for example: `/greet@hello_bot`. Router takes care of removing the `@hello_bot` part from command name automatically.

**Text commands with arguments**

Words can be captured and then processed by using `scanWord` method.

```swift
router["two_words"] = { context in
    let word1 = context.args.scanWord()
    let word2 = context.args.scanWord()
}
```

Array of words can be captured using `scanWords`:

```swift
router["words"] = { context in
    let words = context.args.scanWords() // returns [String] array
}
```

Numbers can be captured using `scanInt`, `scanInt64` and `scanDouble`. `restOfString` captures the remainder as a single string.

```swift
router["command"] = { context in
    let value1 = context.args.scanInt()
    let value2 = context.args.scanDouble()
    let text = context.args.scanRestOfString()
}
```

It's also possible to directly access `NSScanner` used for scanning arguments: `context.args.scanner`.

Handler is expected to read all the arguments, otherwise user will see a warning: _Part of your input was ignored: text_

So, for example, if there's a command `swap` which expects two arguments but user types: `/swap aaa bbb ccc`, he will see:

```
bbb aaa
Part of your input was ignored: ccc
```

A possible way to avoid the warning is to skip unneeded arguments by calling `context.args.skipRestOfString()`.

Also, the warning can be overridden:

```swift
router.partialMatch = { context in
    context.respondAsync("Part of your input was ignored: \(context.args.scanRestOfString())")
    return true
}
```

**Other events**

Router can handle other event types as well. For example, when new user joins the chat, `.new_chat_member` path will be triggered:

```swift
router[.new_chat_member] = { context in
        guard let user = context.message.new_chat_member else { return false }
        guard user.id != bot.user.id else { return false } // Don't greet self
        context.respondAsync("Welcome, \(user.first_name)!")
        return true
}
```

Check `TelegramBot/Router/ContentType.swift` file for a complete list of events supported by Router.

**Handling unmatched paths**

If no paths were matched, router will call it's `unmatched` handler, which will print "Command not found" by default.
This can be overridden by setting an explicit handler:

```swift
router.unmatched = { context in
    // Do something else with context.args
    return true
}
```

### Debugging notes

In debugger you may want to dump the contents of a json structure, but `debugDescription` loses it's formatting.

`prettyPrint` helper function allows printing any `JsonConvertible` with indentation:

```swift
let user: User
user.prettyPrint()

bot.sendMessageSync(fromId, "Hello!")?.prettyPrint()
```

## Examples

There are 3 example projects available:

* `Examples/hello-bot` - a trivial bot which responds to `/greet` command and greets users who join the chat.

* `Examples/word-reverse-bot` - demonstrates how to handle start and stop requests, keep session state and parse command arguments. Behaves differently in private and group chats. Uses a router and a controller.

* `Examples/shopster-bot` - maintains a shopping list using sqlite3 database. Allows creating shared shopping lists in group chats. [GRDB library](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift) is used for working with database.

Details on compiling and running the bots are available on Wiki: [Building and running the example projects](https://github.com/zmeyc/telegram-bot-swift/wiki).

## Documentation

Additional documentation is available on [Telegram Bot Swift SDK Wiki](https://github.com/zmeyc/telegram-bot-swift/wiki).

Check `Examples/` for sample bot projects.

This SDK is a work in progress, expect the API to change very often.
